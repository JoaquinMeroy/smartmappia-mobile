// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// Partners shown on the public marketing page — the logo marquee
// (sections/Logo.jsx), the restaurant grid (sections/Restaurants.jsx) and
// the store grid (sections/Shop.jsx).
//
// THE RULE, and the whole point of this file: the homepage shows exactly
// what is listed in admin, and nothing else. List a restaurant or store and
// it appears; delist it (is_active off, status away from 'active') and it is
// gone. There is no curated array to keep in step — an earlier version
// merged one in, which is why brands kept showing after being taken out and
// why newly onboarded ones did not show at all.
//
// data/restaurants.js is NOT that list any more. It is artwork for the hero
// phone animation and nothing else — see the warning at the top of it.
//
// is_featured is still honoured, as ORDERING rather than as a gate: the
// public endpoints already return featured merchants first, so an admin
// picks which partners lead the grid without deciding who is on it at all.
//
// A merchant needs is_active, status 'active' and its vertical set correctly
// to appear here; those are the backend's filters, not ours. A missing logo
// no longer hides a listing — the card falls back to its initial, because a
// listed merchant silently absent from the homepage is the bug this file
// exists to prevent.
