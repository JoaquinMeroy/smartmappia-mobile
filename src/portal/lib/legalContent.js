    Arabia. We process personal data in accordance with the Personal Data Protection Law of the
    Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Royal Decree No. M/19) and its Implementing Regulations, as

    <h3 class="font-black text-brand-black pt-2">1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>Smart Mappia acts as the data controller responsible for the personal data you provide when
    you book a ride, create an account, or contact our support team. By using the service you
    acknowledge that you have read and understood this Policy.</p>

    <h3 class="font-black text-brand-black pt-2">2. Data We Collect</h3>

      <li>Identity data such as your full name and date of birth.</li>
      <li>Contact data such as your mobile number, WhatsApp number, and email address.</li>

      <li>Booking data such as trip direction, selected airport terminal, district, date, and fare.</li>
      <li>Payment confirmation data such as the proof of transfer you upload for STC Pay.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="font-black text-brand-black pt-2">3. Lawful Basis and Consent</h3>
    <p>We process your personal data on the basis of your explicit consent, the performance of the
    booking contract you enter into with us, and our legitimate interests in operating a safe and
    reliable service. You may withdraw consent at any time, although this may prevent us from
    completing your booking.</p>

    <h3 class="font-black text-brand-black pt-2">4. Use of Location Data</h3>
    <p>Location data is used solely to identify your pickup or drop off point, to match you with a
    driver, and to display your trip on the live map. Sharing your precise GPS location is always
    optional. We collect location only while the app is open and in use. We do not collect your
    location in the background or when the app is closed.</p>

    <h3 class="font-black text-brand-black pt-2">5. How We Use Your Data</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
      <li>To create and manage your account.</li>
      <li>To confirm, schedule, and fulfil your airport transfer bookings.</li>
      <li>To verify payments and issue booking references.</li>
      <li>To communicate with you about your trips and provide customer support.</li>
      <li>To comply with our legal obligations under Saudi law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="font-black text-brand-black pt-2">6. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
    <p>We share your personal data only to the extent necessary to deliver the service, including
    sharing trip details with the assigned driver and payment confirmation data with our payment
    partner. We do not sell your personal data. We may disclose data to competent government
    authorities where required by the laws of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>

    <h3 class="font-black text-brand-black pt-2">7. Data Retention</h3>
    <p>We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes described in
    this Policy, to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and to resolve disputes.
    Records of completed transactions, including the amount charged and the tax applied, are kept
    for the period required by Saudi tax and accounting law even after you delete your account.
    Those retained records are stripped of the details that identify you.</p>

    in anonymised form as described in section 7. If you have already uninstalled the app you can
    request deletion by writing to ${COMPANY.email}.</p>

    <h3 class="font-black text-brand-black pt-2">11. Cross Border Transfers</h3>
    <p>Where personal data needs to be transferred outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we do so
    only in accordance with the Personal Data Protection Law and its Implementing Regulations.</p>

    <h3 class="font-black text-brand-black pt-2">12. Contact and Complaints</h3>
