// in-app bell (and the full Notifications page) can render them nicely.
//
// Types are logged by the backend for BOTH services (spec section 5):
//   Pick & Drop rides -> ride_driver_accepted / on_the_way / arrived /
//                        trip_started / completed / thank_you / cancelled
//   Food delivery     -> food_order_* / food_payment_* / food_rider_assigned /
//                        food_thank_you ...
